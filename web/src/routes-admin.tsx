/**
 * The private admin console, served from admin.prabhixtechnologies.com.
 *
 * <p>A control tower, not a copy of the product. It mounts the platform surfaces and nothing else:
 * the tenant directory, the marketing pipeline, and platform-wide event logs. There is no inbox, no
 * chat, no shop and no settings here, because every one of those acts on a single organization and
 * this console's subject is the platform.
 *
 * <h2>Where the tenant pages went</h2>
 *
 * <p>They are in OneOps, which is where they belong. Prabhix runs its own business as a customer of
 * its own product — signed in at oneops.prabhixtechnologies.com like anybody else — and staff who
 * need to see a customer's data are handed off to the same place, carrying the organization with
 * them. See {@link ./features/ops/TenantsTab.tsx}.
 *
 * <p>The earlier arrangement mounted the whole customer product here and revealed it once an
 * organization was chosen. It was correct about access and wrong about identity: the two consoles
 * were the same 22 feature directories with one page's difference, so nothing on screen told you
 * which app you had opened.
