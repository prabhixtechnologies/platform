/**
 * Organization id to name, for screens that show rows from more than one tenant.
 *
 * <p>Cross-organization views arrive holding ids and nothing else. Event log rows carry
 * `organizationId` but no name, and a column of UUIDs is unreadable — you cannot tell at a glance
 * whether the errors are all from one customer or spread across twenty, which is the entire question
 * such a view exists to answer.
 *
 * <p>Deliberately not solved on the server: the event log is a partitioned table read by the page,
 * and joining organizations into every row would cost far more than one small lookup here.
 *
 * <p>Lives in `lib/` rather than `features/ops/` because the log pages are shared by both consoles
 * and must not import the ops feature — that would pull the platform admin code into the customer
 * product's bundle. `enabled` keeps it from firing there at all.
