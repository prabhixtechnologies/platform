# Moves the production secrets out of deploy/.env.prod and into AWS Secrets Manager.
#
# Run once, on the production host, as the prabhix user:
#
#   bash deploy/aws/secrets-bootstrap.sh           # copy into Secrets Manager and verify
#   bash deploy/aws/secrets-bootstrap.sh --prune   # ...and then strip them from .env.prod
#
# It runs on the host and not from a workstation on purpose. The values are already on this disk;
# copying them to a laptop first would put them somewhere new, which is the opposite of the point.
#
# Idempotent: creates each secret, or adds a new version if it already exists. Never prints a secret
# value — it compares checksums to prove the round-trip, so a truncated or re-encoded value is caught
# without the value appearing in a terminal or a log.
