# Builds the images CI would build, and pushes them to ECR, from a workstation.
#
# This exists because GitHub Actions is on metered billing since the repositories went private and
# will not start a job, so nothing can be released through CI. It is a stand-in for the pipeline and
# not a replacement for it: it does not run the test suites, and it trusts whoever runs it to have
# done that.
#
# It mirrors .github/workflows/ci.yml deliberately. The build arguments are the part that matters --
# Vite and Next inline them at build time, so an image built without them is not a slower version of
# the right one, it is a different product with features missing. Changing a build argument in one
# place and not the other is how the marketing site came to address an organization that did not
# exist. If you edit the arguments here, edit the workflow too.
#
# Usage:
#   pwsh Platform/deploy/aws/build-push.ps1                      # everything
#   pwsh Platform/deploy/aws/build-push.ps1 -Only identity
