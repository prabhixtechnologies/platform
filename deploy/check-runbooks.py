"""Check that the runbooks refer to files, JSON and resources that exist.

A runbook is followed once, by hand, usually under time pressure, and a step that names a file which
was renamed six commits ago fails at the worst moment. Nothing else in the repository reads these
documents, so nothing else notices.

Three classes of rot, all of which have a cheap mechanical check:

  1. A referenced path that no longer exists. `file://deploy/aws/x.json` in a command, or a
     `deploy/RUNBOOK-y.md` in prose.
  2. A referenced JSON policy that exists but is not valid JSON — the AWS CLI reports this as a
     parameter validation error that does not name the file.
  3. An account, region, instance or IP repeated across documents that disagree between them. These
     are copied by hand and there are enough of them that one going stale is likely.

Not checked: whether the AWS resources exist, which needs credentials and would make this a test of
the account rather than of the documents.
